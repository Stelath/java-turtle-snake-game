# Java Turtle Snake Game
 The classic game of snake but made with the Java turtles library... why? because I can.
 We had to make a turtle game for a class project, if you would like to play it download the files and open the project.bluej file, hit the compile button and run the SnakeGame class. Just a warning before hand, because this was made with the turtle library which was in no way intended to make a game this may be the most resource intensive game of snake ever made.
